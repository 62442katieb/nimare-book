# PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)

To begin our journey into the world of neuroimaging meta-analyses, we will first discuss the importance of reporting and reproducibility in scientific research. We will then introduce the PRISMA guidelines, which are a set of guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.



## What is PRISMA?

PRISMA is a set of guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The guidelines are intended to help authors and readers of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to understand the methods used in a given study, and to facilitate the interpretation of the results. The PRISMA guidelines are intended to be a minimum standard for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The PRISMA statement is a 27-item checklist that authors can use to ensure that their manuscript includes all of the necessary information for a reader to understand the methods used in a given study. The PRISMA statement is available at <https://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/Default.aspx>.
