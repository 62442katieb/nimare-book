# Methods to choose from
When coming up with your search process, you should have decided whether you were going to use a coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) or an image-based meta-analysis (IBMA).
While in previous meta-analyses you may been constrained by the tool you were using to perform the meta-analysis, Neurosynth-Compose allows you to use a multitude of methods.

## CBMA

While sharing of statistical maps is becoming more common, it is still not the norm, and aggregation of statistical maps is still a difficult process.
Coordinates are much more commonly shared.

## IBMA

Image based meta-analysis is relatively new in the field of neuroimaging, although the methods have been around for a while since we can perform a more standard meta-analysis on the statistical maps where each voxel looked at for consensus whereas coordinates have to be transformed by some method to guess what the underlying statistical map looks like.
